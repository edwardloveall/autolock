This script checks every five minutes (configurable) to see if you're on a specified safe network, such as your home network.
If you are, it disables the "Require password X seconds after sleep or screensaver begins" preference on a Mac.
If it can't find that network, it enables that lock preference.

In practice, this means your computer will require a password when you're out and about, but not force you to enter your password over and over again at home.
